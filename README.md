# OctoPrint-Mobile

Octoprint mini iPhone UI as iOS app and Octoprint UI plugin (only works on dev branch of Octoprint)

The iOS app is need only to force landscape, load the API key. Bonus feature: shake to refresh.

As long as octoprint is avalable over the internet, the UI changes to full screen webcam for pure monitoring.
